The BigSky MX is Strymon's flagship reverb unit and the successor to the original BigSky that put the company on the map years ago. The bar was very high for this product. I developed a system for machine learning assisted reverb algorithm design and optimization for this project that was used to accurately emulate plate, hall, spring, chamber, and room reverbs. I also designed a number of other DSP algorithms for high quality pitch shifting, harmonic enhancement, and real-time convolution.

In addition, I worked as the firmware architect and lead firmware engineer for this product and worked closely with the hardware team to develop the system design. It's a complex multicore MPU system that requires high performance on tight resource constraints, making the design and development quite challenging.
