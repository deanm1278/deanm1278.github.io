During my time at Adafruit I designed a number of Microcontroller development boards, sensor evaluation boards, and other educational products. I also developed accompanying firmware, board support packages, and code libraries to support these products.

Some examples include Metro M4 Express, Grand Central M4, NeoTrellis, NeoTrellis M4 Express, Seesaw general purpose helper chip system, and many more.
